## Patterns

Some observations:

What you will see in the code is the current state of a process of discovery.

There are a lot of insightful patterns out there besides CA's. 

CA's are good -  and so are many of the others.

Would it not be a nice thing to be able to compare and contrast patterns from a variety of sources?

Can we not use our computer skills to fetch and collate and organize thousands of patterns?

Would it be possible to so curate and DJ the patterns into a fascinating number of separate boutiques or galleries of patterns?

Could we not assemble these groups patterns for homemakers, designers, contractors or developers?

Could we not do the same for different languages and locales?

And most importantly, can we not do this mostly by algorithm?

Can we not access a ton of stuff on the Internet and make it more accessible and convenient for special circumstances and needs?

If we were able to package a plethora of patterns for architecture, then could we not do the same for agriculture or law or accounting?

> A Pattern Language

> You can use this book to design a house for yourself with your family; you can use it to work with your neighbors to improve your town and neighborhood; you can use it to design an office, or a workshop, or a public building. And you can use it to guide you in the actual process of construction. 
 
> At the core of these books is the idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets, and communities. This idea may be radical (it implies a radical transformation of the architectural profession) but it comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people. 
 
> At the core of the books, too, is the point that in designing their environments people always rely on certain "languages," which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a forma system which gives them coherence. This book provides a language of this kind. It will enable a person to make a design for almost any kind of building, or any part of the built environment. 
 
> "Patterns," the units of this language, are answers to design problems (How high should a window sill be? How many stories should a building have? How much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and trees?). More than 250 of the patterns in this pattern language are given: each consists of a problem statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seemly likely that they will be a part of human nature, and human action, as much in five hundred years as they are today.
